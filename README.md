Anyways lets see the installation steps:

1. **Install the package**  
   Run:  
   ```bash
   pip install PY-TELUGU-VERSION
   ```
2. **running watcher command**
   - now open any python file and you have to run command in backgroung
   ```bash
   pythontel filename.py
    ```
   - this translates the keywords and stuff into telugu language
3. **To execute the file**
   - run this cmd to execute the telugu language py file
   ```bash
   pythonrun filename.py
   ```
and tha;t all , simple ai't it? <br>
